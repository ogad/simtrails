Contrail Detection Algorithms
=============================

Contrail detection algorithm objects are constructed to take an imager and a
scene and return a binary mask indicating the presence of contrails in the scene.

In applying the algorithm, the imager is used to simulate the observation of the
sceneâ€”the fields don't need pre-calculating.
