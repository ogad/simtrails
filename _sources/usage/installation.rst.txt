The package can be acquired by cloning the repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://www.github.com/ogad/simtrails.git

You can then use pip to install from the source code. This will install the package in the current Python environment and make it available for import in other Python scripts:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install path/to/package

The path should be the root directory of the package, containing the
pyproject.toml file.
