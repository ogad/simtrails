Imagers
=======

Imagers are used to simulate the observation of a scene by a sensor.

An imager contains a set of imager channels, each of which has its own wavelength
parameterisation (called ``mol_abs_param``) to describe how to do radiative transfer
calculations for that channel. They also describe noise and resolution
characteristics of the sensor.
