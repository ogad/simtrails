Mannstein line-filtering algorithm
===================================
.. TODO: the mannstein aglorithm implementation

The Mannstein algorithm, which comes from Mannstein et al. (1999) [1]_, is a line-filtering algorithm
which acts on a combination of BT and BTD images from infrared channels. The
specific implementation used here is as implemented by McCloskey et al. (2021) [2]_.

Much of the documentaton is left unchaged from the original implementation.
